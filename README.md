# Connect Four AI Agent

This project implements an AI agent for the game Connect Four using the Python programming language. The AI agent utilizes the Minimax algorithm and can play against a human player or another ai on [this game website](http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/).

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. Minimax algorithm: The AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves in the game.

2. Alpha-Beta pruning: The AI agent's performance is further improved by implementing the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, which reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository for the project.

2. Run the project using this command:

```
python game.py 
```

3. Choose the desired algorithm type and difficulty level for the game using the provided GUI.

4. Open the [Game Website](http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/) for the AI agent

5. Start and leave the AI agent to play against the opponent in the website.
